# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Node.js (CommonJS), 
**Database**: 
**Testing**: Vitest
**Validation**: 
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Security Framework

This project follows the MaintainabilityAI security-first SDLC framework:
- OWASP Top 10 prompt packs for security guidance
- STRIDE threat modeling for design reviews
- Fitness functions for automated quality gates
- Golden Rules of Vibe Coding for governance

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build
npm run build
```

## Security Workflow

1. **Be specific** — Define intent and security constraints in prompts
2. **Trust but verify** — Never merge AI-generated code without understanding it
3. **Treat AI like a junior dev** — Review, guide, and validate suggestions
4. **Isolate AI changes** — Use separate commits/PRs; label AI-assisted changes
5. **Document rationale** — Explain the "why" in code comments and commit messages
6. **Share winning prompts** — Capture effective prompts in `/prompts` for reuse

## Commit Labeling

Always use the AI disclosure label in commits:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication

🤖 AI-assisted with [tool] using MaintainabilityAI prompt packs"
```
